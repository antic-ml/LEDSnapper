# LEDSnapper
A simple, but useful LED diagnostic PCB board for breadboard projects.

If you are forever plugging LEDs and resistors into breadboards to monitor
signal output from a chip, then you may find this board useful. It plugs
into your breadboard and there are 8 pins connected to 5 mm LEDs with
wich you can use to monitor signals. I call it LEDSnapper, beacause it 
snaps into your breadboard.

How To Use
----------

Connect up the GND pin and then connect one, or more of the 8 pins
connected to LEDs to +5 Volts.

Choose from 3 different boards

There are 3 different versions of the board. Check the PCB layout images
below to see which one you require. Below each image you will find the
name of the associated Gerber files for that board.
