# Enemies And Friends

A number of people and organisations have helped and have stood in the way of the development and promotion
of LEDSnapper. As part of the trials and tribulations record of an open source hardware
developer I am recording them here on this list. Don't ask for explanations for why a group,
or individual is on the enemies list, that is between me and them.
