# Enemies And Friends List

A number of people and organisations have helped and others have stood in the way of the development and promotion
of **LEDSnapper**. As part of the trials and tribulations record of an open source hardware
developer I am recording them here on this list. 

| Enemies of Super Mario                   | Friends of Super Mario                   |

The list is partly tongue-in-cheek. Its inspiration comes from the movie starring
Steve Martin called _Dead Men Don't Wear Plaid_, a comedy in which he has a list of friends
and enemies that he methodically goes through. The things I have experienced whilst
promoting this project have been faintly comical.
